Key Analysis Steps:

District Summary: The analysis begins with a summary of the district's key metrics, including the total number of schools, students, budget, and average test scores. It also calculates the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects.

School Summary: The code then calculates school-level summaries, including the type of each school, the total number of students, budget, and average test scores. It also determines the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects for each school.

Top and Bottom Performing Schools: The code ranks and displays the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools based on overall passing rates.

Math and Reading Scores by Grade: The analysis includes separate data frames that provide average math and reading scores for students in each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending: The data is categorized into spending ranges per student, and average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects, are calculated for each spending range.

Scores by School Size: Schools are categorized into small, medium, and large based on the number of students. The analysis provides average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects for each school size category.

Scores by School Type: The analysis categorizes schools as either Charter or District and calculates average math and reading scores, along with the percentage of students passing math, reading, and both subjects for each school type.
